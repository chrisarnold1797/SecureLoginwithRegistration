# SecureLoginwithRegistration
Simple C++ program for secure login with registration

A simple C++ program to login and register users. The system is designed to do five things: 1) register users, 2) login users, 3) record a bio, 4) save the information in a text file, and 5) hash the password with salt prior to export. Numerous possibilities exist for development depending on the environment. For example, in its current state the system is tailored to a small number of users by creating a separate file for each. However, the code could be expanded where users' data is output to a database and compensates for an enterprise environment with various users. The purpose of this system is to demonstrate secure authentication where the passwords are salted, which prevents numerous attacks. The C++ Bcrypt Wrapper provides access to the hashing algorithm in this secure authentication system. The system of authentication delivered here, is not a silver bullet, and should not be confused as impenetrable. Never forget to include layers of defense. Stay secure, and have fun with the code!
